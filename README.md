## bugs 
- function loopAllOptions() removeEventListener only removes THAT particular option chosen's event listener, need to remove all to prevent clogging memory
- reveal.js allows skipping forward, adding #/SLIDENUMBERHERE after the url, fix by using https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_get_url.asp https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_doc_url.asp
- spam clicking the first continue button skips the intro screen
